## A simple true or false game

There will be a set of questions in a question bank that's having true or false answers.

Each question in the question bank will be asked to the user where they will input true or false as answer

if the user's answer was correct, then it will tells them if they got it right or wrong and increase their score. 

Once all the questions are asked from the question bank, it will tells the user their final score.

We can generate different questions to create question bank using [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/):
